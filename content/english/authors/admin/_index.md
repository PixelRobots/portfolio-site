I am a student in Economics with a demonstrated interest in quantitative economics. I like to find patterns in data and extract knowledge from it to solve problems. From Econometrics modelling to interpreting p-values I like to share the results of my findings in a clear and approachable way.
Most importantly I'm curious and eager to learn new things. My current pursuits are data science and machine learning for which I've been spending significant amount of time in learning both theory and programming skills which include R and Python. I like to challenge on real world data from Kaggle.
