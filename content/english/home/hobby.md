My hobby is analogue photography.  I have been making photos since my childhood.  I develop and print my black and white photos. My collection of analogue cameras is ranging from half-frame cameras that use a film size of 18x24 mm to early 20th century large format 9x12 cm folders.  I almost always carry a camera that is older than I, on working trips usually a tiny halfframe, and on vacation a large-format folding and several other cameras.

I am always happy to meet friends, fellow colleauges or collectors.
